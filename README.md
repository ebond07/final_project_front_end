## Project Description

The application allows users to create up to four ideal weather weeks in terms of temperature.
There are drop down menus which allow for the selection of the weeks as well as the deletion of them.

The front-end for the project was built on Microsoft Visual Studio Code using React JS and the back-end was built on IntelliJ.

### External Libraries used

https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/

React-Toastify was used to create pop ups on the side of the window to alert the user whether the requests were succesful

https://github.com/oliviertassinari/react-swipeable-views

React-Swipeable-Views were used to allow the user to swipe between three options "Cloudy,Sunny,Rainy" for their day.

### Running the Project

To run the project you must open both the back-end and the front-end folders on their respective softwares. Then for the front-end you must install the node modules using "npm install" if you do not have the correct modules for the project. Then for the back-end you will have to run the application within IntelliJ.

From then you can use the front-end as you wish.

### Challenges Faced

There were major challenges faced while developing the project. Firstly, I was not able to implement a get request for getting the data which has been posted to the server. I was not making a proper request and as such was receivingn an error every time I tried to. Secondly, I could not figure out how to implement a put request for updating the days as I was not able to figure out how to obtain the id of the day the user wished to update and within which week it was and then update it.

Both these requests I would really like to implement in the future as they are necessary for the project to be 100% functional. At the moment, the project is only about 75% functional.

## Design

### Class Structure

3 additional components besides app.js were added to keep the code clean.

Firstly, the boxes component was used to generate the boxes which have the counter for the temperature, the two buttons to modify the counter as well as the titles for the days, the sliders, and the button to submit the day. There is also a reset temps button to reset the temperatures for the days that is in the boxes component. The drop down menu for initializing a week is located in the boxes component so that the selected option can be put in a variable and used in the post request made in the boxes component.

Secondly, the weeklyselector component is used to generate the drop down menu for deleting a week.

Finally, the response component is used to generate the function which the buttons in the boxes class use for submitting the days. Inside this class there should also be the get requests which would get the information which has been posted in the boxes class and then display it below the header in the response component.

### End Points

For posting to a specific week, http://localhost:8080/api/weeks/${weekNumber}/days was used.
For getting a specific day, http://localhost:8080/api/days/${dayID} should be used.
For deleting a week, http://localhost:8080/api/weeks/${weekNumber} was used.
For posting a week and initializing it, http://localhost:8080/api/weeks was used.
For updating a specific day, http://localhost:8080/api/days/${dayID} should be used.

### Front-End

The two drop down menus at the top of the screen are used for selecting the week which you either want to delete or initialize depending on the drop down menu selected.

The buttons to the right of the drop down menus are for confirming you selection and making the equivalent request to the back-end.

The button on the left of all the boxes is to reset the counters of all the boxes back to 0.

The buttons inside the boxes are used to update the counter. The + button updates the counter by +1 and the - button updates the counter by -1

The counter itself changes colour depending on its value. When above 0 it is shown in red and when 0 and below it is shown in blue.
